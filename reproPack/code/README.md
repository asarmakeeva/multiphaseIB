To get container with the solver code
`docker push asarmakeeva/cfdem_ib:v5`

Folders:
- cases: running test cases
- forcemodels: 2 force models to provide coupling which could be compiled in CFDEMcoupling
- solvers: solvers code for 2 different algorithms for free surface reconstruction


to run cases inside of the container:

cd /home/cfdem/CFDEM/run/falling_sphere_1_phase/CFD/run.sh

all cases located:

cd /home/cfdem/CFDEM/run/
